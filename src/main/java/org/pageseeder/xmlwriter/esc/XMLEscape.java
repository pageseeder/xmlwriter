 * An interface to escape XML character data.

 * <p>This interface assumes that the values to be escapes do not orignate from
 * XML text, in order words, there should not be already any entity or markup
 * in the document. If it is the case the methods in this class should also
 * escapes them. Thus "&amp;amp;" would be represented as "&amp;amp;amp;".
 *
 * <p>Also the method will not try to escape characters that cannot be escaped.
 *
 * <p>This class is mostly concerned about producing well formed XML and
 * not does attempt to produce valid data.

   * in the attribute markup. Since this method is not aware of which type of
